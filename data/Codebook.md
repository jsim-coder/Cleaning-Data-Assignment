## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set at
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones



## How to run

## The output of this scipt contains two interim output files and the final tidy summary data
## The files are produced in the following order as the data is transformed from raw to tidy data
##
## 1. merged.csv -  An interim table containing the merge of test and training data 
##                  with feature headings
## 2. clean.csv -   An interim table of the merged data from the merged.csv file but now contains
##                  subject and activity variables. The remaining measurement variables
##                  have been changed to a more readable format
## 3. tidy_mean_output.txt -    This output is the end result of the analysis
